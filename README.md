# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

- Written for a case interview
- Built to show knowledge of React, redux-toolkit and testing
- It shows the weather.

I tried using technologies that I have not used before, to challenge myself. Setup the project with Mantine UI, which i had never used before. Also used React-router-dom v6.

What took the most time was settting up the test suite to work.

Wish I had more time to write some unit tests around the application, but wanted to show some actual code over tests.

Used vite and SWC for faster work environment

## Installation

```Typescript
yarn / npm install
